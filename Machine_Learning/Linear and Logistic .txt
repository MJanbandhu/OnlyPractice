Linear Regression = Linear regression is used to find the linear relationship between independent and dependent variables by fitting a straight line to predict a continuous outcome.

Logistic Regression = Logistic regression is used to find the relationship between independent variables and a categorical (binary) dependent variable by fitting an S-shaped (sigmoid) curve to predict the probability of an outcome.
