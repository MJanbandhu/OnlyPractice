    "# what is Timeseries?\n",
    "* Time Series algorithm provides multiple algorithms that are optimized for forecasting continuous values, such as product sales, over time.A time series model can predict trends based only on the original dataset that is used to create the model.\n",
    "* Across industries, organizations commonly use time series data, which means any information collected over a regular interval of time, in their operations. Examples include daily stock prices, energy consumption rates, social media engagement metrics and retail demand, among others. Analyze time series data yields insights like trends, seasonal patterns and forecasts into future events that can help generate profits. For example, by understanding the seasonal trends in demand for retail products, companies can plan promotions to maximize sales throughout the year.\n",
    "\n",
    "**White noise**\n",
    "* A time series is white noise if the variables are independent and identically distributed with a mean of zero. This means that all variables have the same variance (sigma^2) and each value has a zero correlation with all other values in the series.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data patterns**\n",
    "\n",
    "**cycle**\n",
    "* A cyclic pattern occurs when data rise and fall, but this does not happen within the fixed time and the duration of these fluctuations is usually at least 2 years\n",
    "![](cycle.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Trend**\n",
    "* A trend pattern exists when there is a long-term increase or decrease in the series. The trend can be linear, exponential\n",
    "![](trend.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Seasonal**\n",
    "* Seasonality exists when data is influenced by seasonal factors, such as a day of the week, a month, and one-quarter of the     year. A seasonal pattern exists of a fixed known period.\n",
    "![](sea.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Random**\n",
    "* which do not follow any trend ,cycle or seasonal patterns\n",
    "![](ran.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Types**\n",
    "* Types of time series models are moving average,ARIMA.The crucial thing is to choose the right forecasting method as per the characteristics of the time series data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**MA(Moving Average)**\n",
    "* A moving average is defined as an average of fixed number of items in the time series which move through the series by dropping the top items of the previous averaged group and adding the next in each successive average.\n",
    "Yt depends only on random error terms\n",
    "     \tYt = f( εt, εt-1, εt-2, εt-3, ..)\n",
    "\t\tor\n",
    " \tYt = β + εt + θ1 εt-1 + θ2εt-2 + θ3 εt-3 +…\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**AR(Auto Regressive)**\n",
    "* Autoregression is a time series model that uses observations from previous time steps as input to a regression equation to predict the value at the next time step. It is a very simple idea that can result in accurate forecasts on a range of time series problems.\n",
    "* Yt depends only of past values. \n",
    "* Yt-1, Yt-2, Yt-3 etc\n",
    "              * Yt  = f(Yt-1, Yt-2, Yt-3… )\n",
    "              * Yt = β0 + β1Yt-1 + β2Yt-2 + β3Yt-3 …\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**ARMA**\n",
    "* Time series, autoregressive–moving-average (ARMA) models provide a parsimonious description of a (weakly) stationary stochastic process in terms of two polynomials, one for the autoregression (AR) and the second for the moving average (MA).\n",
    "* Combines AR and MA\n",
    "\t* Yt = β0 + β1Yt-1 + β2Yt-2 + β3Yt-3 …εt + θ1 εt-1 + θ2εt-2 + θ3 εt-3 +…\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**ARIMA**\n",
    "* Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model is another widely used forecasting technique that involves the combination of two or more time series models. This model is suitable for multivariate non-stationary data. ARIMA method is based on the concepts of autoregression, autocorrelation, and moving average.\n",
